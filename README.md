## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Raphaël Assénat for his [original web-based gbcamtool](https://www.raphnet.net/programmation/gbcam2png/index_en.php), the inspiration for this version. Despite similarities, all code here is my own, none was copied from the original.

Thanks to Jeff F. for the [GB Camera Tech Info V1.2 document](http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/gbcam.txt), with which I wrote my own routines for decoding images and ignoring deleted pictures from the cartridge.
